# Secure Password Manager
This is a simple C/C++ program that shows a simple way, which may not be the most secure, but that may be coming later ;)
to save and store your passwords on your machine!

# Picture Demo of it working

# Planned Updates
1. Improve the encryption and decryption algorithms so that they will utilize the special code and use that as their key
2. LAN Password storing. IE: If the user has a raspberry pi, they can have the passwords saved/stored there too as a backup
